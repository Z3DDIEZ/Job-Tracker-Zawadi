## 🎯 Why I Built This

As a CS student applying to 80+ companies for graduate roles, I needed a centralized system to:
- Track all applications in one place
- Monitor interview stages across multiple companies
- Identify which companies offer visa sponsorship
- Analyze my application success rate

This project solved my own problem while demonstrating full-stack development skills.

## 💡 What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- Building responsive UIs without frameworks
- Working with Firebase Realtime Database
- Implementing CRUD operations with real-time sync
- Creating reusable JavaScript functions
- Managing application state

### Soft Skills
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks
- Designing user-centric interfaces
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Deploying production-ready applications

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Firebase account (for your own deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Z3DDIEZ/Job-Tracker-Zawadi.git
   cd Job-Tracker-Zawadi
```

2. **Set up Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Realtime Database
   - Copy your Firebase config
   - Replace the config in `index.html` (lines 110-118)

3. **Open in browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your browser
   - No build process required (vanilla JavaScript)

4. **Start adding applications**
   - Fill out the form
   - Watch real-time updates
   - Test all CRUD operations

## 📁 Project Structure
## 🔐 Security Notes

- Firebase API keys are public by design (frontend apps)
- Security enforced through Firebase Security Rules
- Only allows read/write to "applications" path
- No authentication required for personal use
- For production with multiple users, add Firebase Authentication

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Earthy Monochrome Palette:**
- Primary: Slate grays (#0f172a to #f8fafc)
- Accent: Warm terra cotta (#d97706)
- Semantic: Subtle pastels for status indicators

**Modern CSS Techniques:**
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- CSS Grid for layout
- Flexbox for components
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 🚀 Future Improvements

If I continue building this, I would add:
- [ ] User authentication (multi-user support)
- [ ] Email reminders for follow-ups
- [ ] Calendar integration for interview scheduling
- [ ] Export data to CSV
- [ ] Interview notes and feedback tracking
- [ ] Company research links and notes
- [ ] Application statistics and analytics
